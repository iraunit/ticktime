# Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration mismatches caused by:
1. Browser extensions adding attributes (like `data-arp=""`) to the HTML element
2. Client-side only code running during server-side rendering
3. Service worker registration during initial render
4. Performance monitoring initialization during hydration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. HTML Element Suppression
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<html>` element in `layout.tsx`
- This tells React to ignore hydration mismatches for this specific element

### 2. Hydration Boundary Component
- Created `HydrationBoundary` component that ensures proper client-side rendering
- Wraps the entire application to handle hydration gracefully

### 3. Client-Only Components
- Created `ClientOnly` component for components that should only render on client
- Applied to components that might cause hydration issues:
  - `GlobalErrorHandler`
  - `GlobalLoadingOverlay`
  - `NetworkStatusIndicator`
  - `Toaster` (toast notifications)

### 4. Custom Hooks
- Created `useHydration` and `useClientOnly` hooks
- Provides better control over hydration state

### 5. Next.js Configuration
- Optimized webpack configuration for development
- Added proper static asset handling
- Enabled font optimization

### 6. Delayed Initialization
- Service worker registration delayed by 100ms
- Performance monitoring delayed by 100ms
- All client-side operations properly guarded with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`

## Usage

### For Components That Should Only Render on Client:
```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@/components/providers/client-only';

<ClientOnly>
  <ComponentThatUsesWindow />
</ClientOnly>
```

### For Custom Hooks:
```tsx
import { useClientOnly } from '@/hooks/use-hydration';

function MyComponent() {
  const isClient = useClientOnly();
  
  if (!isClient) return null;
  
  return <div>Client-only content</div>;
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates hydration warnings** caused by browser extensions
2. **Improves performance** by preventing unnecessary re-renders
3. **Better user experience** with proper loading states
4. **Maintains SEO** while ensuring client-side functionality
5. **Future-proof** solution that handles various hydration scenarios

## Testing
- Test on different browsers with various extensions
- Verify CSS loads properly on port 3000
- Check that all interactive features work correctly
- Ensure no console warnings about hydration mismatches
