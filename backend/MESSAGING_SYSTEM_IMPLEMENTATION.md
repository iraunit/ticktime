# Messaging System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the messaging system backend for the InfluencerConnect platform, completing Task 6 from the implementation plan.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Conversation Model and Message Endpoints ✅

**Models:**

- Automatic conversation creation when first message is sent

### 2. Real-time Messaging with WebSocket Support ✅

**WebSocket Consumer:**
- `MessagingConsumer`: Handles real-time messaging via WebSocket connections
- JWT token authentication for WebSocket connections
- Support for message sending, typing indicators, and read status updates
- Room-based messaging (one room per deal)

**Features:**
- Real-time message delivery
- Typing indicators
- Read status broadcasting
- Secure authentication via JWT tokens
- Access control (users can only access their own deals)

**Configuration:**
- Django Channels integration with Redis backend
- ASGI application configuration
- WebSocket routing setup

### 3. File Attachment Handling ✅

**File Support:**
- Images (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Documents (PDF, DOC, etc.)
- File metadata storage (name, size)
- Secure file upload and storage

**Features:**
- File validation and security checks
- Automatic file metadata extraction
- File filtering in message queries
- Secure download links

### 4. Message Read Status Tracking ✅

**Read Status Features:**
- Separate read flags for influencers and brands
- Automatic read marking when messages are retrieved
- Read timestamp tracking
- Unread message count calculation

**API Features:**
- Auto-mark messages as read when fetched
- Read status updates via WebSocket
- Unread count in conversation listings

### 5. Message History and Pagination Functionality ✅

**Enhanced Message Querying:**
- Full-text search in message content
- Date range filtering
- Sender type filtering (influencer/brand)
- Attachment-only filtering
- Comprehensive pagination support

**Pagination:**
- Configurable page sizes
- Next/previous page navigation
- Total count information
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

### 6. Comprehensive Tests ✅

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for all messaging endpoints
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- File attachment testing
- Read status functionality testing
- Pagination and filtering tests
- Error handling and edge cases
- Permission and access control tests

**Test Files:**
- `test_messaging_system.py`: 24 comprehensive unit tests
- `test_messaging_integration.py`: 6 integration tests
- `test_websocket_messaging.py`: WebSocket functionality tests

## API Endpoints

### Conversations
- `GET /api/conversations/` - List all conversations with filtering and pagination
- Supports filters: `status`, `unread_only`
- Includes conversation metadata, last message, and unread counts

### Messages
- `GET /api/deals/{deal_id}/messages/` - List messages for a deal with advanced filtering
- `POST /api/deals/{deal_id}/messages/` - Send a new message
- `GET /api/deals/{deal_id}/messages/{message_id}/` - Get message details
- `PATCH /api/deals/{deal_id}/messages/{message_id}/` - Update message (within 5 minutes)
- `DELETE /api/deals/{deal_id}/messages/{message_id}/` - Delete message (within 5 minutes)

### WebSocket
- `ws://localhost:8000/ws/deals/{deal_id}/messages/?token={jwt_token}` - Real-time messaging

## Advanced Features

### Message Filtering
- **Search**: Full-text search in message content
- **Date Range**: Filter by creation date
- **Sender Type**: Filter by influencer or brand messages
- **Attachments**: Show only messages with file attachments

### Message Management
- **Edit Messages**: Users can edit their own messages within 5 minutes
- **Delete Messages**: Users can delete their own messages within 5 minutes
- **File Attachments**: Support for various file types with metadata

### Real-time Features
- **Live Messaging**: Instant message delivery via WebSocket
- **Typing Indicators**: Show when someone is typing
- **Read Receipts**: Real-time read status updates
- **Online Status**: Connection status tracking

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token authentication for both REST API and WebSocket
- User can only access their own deals and conversations
- Proper permission checks on all endpoints

### File Security
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Secure file storage
- Protected download URLs

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Efficient query optimization with select_related and prefetch_related
- Pagination to handle large datasets

### Caching
- Redis integration for WebSocket channel layers
- Efficient message retrieval with proper ordering

### File Handling
- Optimized file upload handling
- Metadata extraction and storage
- Efficient file serving

## Requirements Compliance

All requirements from Requirement 6 have been fully implemented:

✅ **6.1**: Messaging interface specific to collaboration - Implemented with deal-specific conversations
✅ **6.2**: Text messages, file attachments, and image sharing - Full support implemented
✅ **6.3**: Real-time notifications and read/unread status - WebSocket implementation with read tracking
✅ **6.4**: Conversation history with timestamps and sender identification - Complete message history
✅ **6.5**: File storage with secure download links - Implemented with metadata tracking
