## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication (`IsAuthenticated` permission)
- User can only access their own data (profile-based filtering)
- Input validation for all user-submitted data
- Rate limiting considerations for notification endpoints
- Secure handling of financial data (earnings, payments)

## Performance Optimizations

- Database query optimization with `select_related` and `prefetch_related`
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient aggregation queries for statistics
- Indexed database fields for common queries
- Caching considerations for frequently accessed data

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time WebSocket notifications
- Advanced analytics with charts and graphs
- Export functionality for collaboration records
- Email notifications for important updates
- Mobile push notifications
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
