# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the Django backend from a monolithic structure (single `core` app) to a modular multi-app architecture. The current backend has all functionality consolidated in one `core` app, which makes it difficult to maintain, scale, and organize as the codebase grows. The goal is to break down the functionality into logical, domain-specific Django apps that follow Django best practices and improve code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the codebase to be organized into logical Django apps, so that I can easily locate, maintain, and extend specific functionality without navigating through a monolithic structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the backend SHALL have separate Django apps for authentication, user management, influencer functionality, brand functionality, campaign management, deal management, messaging, and content management
2. WHEN a developer needs to work on authentication features THEN they SHALL find all authentication-related code in the `authentication` app
3. WHEN a developer needs to work on influencer features THEN they SHALL find all influencer-related code in the `influencer` app
4. WHEN a developer needs to work on brand features THEN they SHALL find all brand-related code in the `brand` app

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want each Django app to have its own models, views, serializers, and URLs, so that the code is properly encapsulated and follows Django's app-based architecture principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each app is created THEN it SHALL contain its own models.py, views.py, serializers.py, urls.py, and admin.py files
2. WHEN models are moved to their respective apps THEN they SHALL maintain all existing relationships and constraints
3. WHEN views are moved to their respective apps THEN they SHALL maintain all existing functionality and API endpoints
4. WHEN serializers are moved to their respective apps THEN they SHALL maintain all existing validation and field definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the database migrations to be handled properly during the refactoring, so that existing data is preserved and the database schema remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are moved between apps THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate database migrations
2. WHEN migrations are applied THEN existing data SHALL be preserved without loss
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the database schema SHALL remain functionally identical to the original
4. WHEN foreign key relationships exist between models THEN they SHALL be properly maintained across app boundaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the API endpoints to remain unchanged after refactoring, so that the frontend application continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL remain accessible at the same URLs
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL return the same response format and data structure as before
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL work exactly as it did before the refactoring
4. WHEN the API is tested THEN all existing functionality SHALL pass the same test cases

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want proper inter-app communication and imports, so that apps can reference models and functionality from other apps when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an app needs to reference a model from another app THEN it SHALL use proper Django import statements
2. WHEN circular imports could occur THEN the system SHALL use string references for foreign keys and relationships
3. WHEN apps need to communicate THEN they SHALL follow Django best practices for inter-app dependencies
4. WHEN the system starts THEN there SHALL be no import errors or circular dependency issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the new app structure to be properly configured in Django settings, so that all apps are recognized and function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new apps are created THEN they SHALL be added to the INSTALLED_APPS setting
2. WHEN the Django server starts THEN all apps SHALL be properly loaded and initialized
3. WHEN admin interfaces are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured in each app's admin.py
4. WHEN URL routing is configured THEN each app's URLs SHALL be properly included in the main URL configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the refactored code works correctly, so that I can be confident that no functionality was broken during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without modification
2. WHEN new import statements are used THEN they SHALL be tested to ensure they work correctly
3. WHEN the API is tested THEN all endpoints SHALL return expected responses
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL work correctly with the new app structure
